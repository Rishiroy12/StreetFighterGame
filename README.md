# StreetFighterGame

Creating a Street Fighter game using Python, spritesheets, and object-oriented programming (OOP) involves breaking down the game into classes and using spritesheets for character animations. Below is a simplified example using the Pygame library for graphics handling.
The Player class represents the main player character. It inherits from pygame.sprite.Sprite to take advantage of sprite features.
The player's movements are controlled by the arrow keys, and the player is prevented from moving outside the window boundaries.
The game loop handles events, updates the game state, and draws the player on the screen.
